# ogbeni-virtual-assistant
a virtual assitant program that uses several libraries to perform various tasks through voice commands. 
It uses the speech_recognition library to listen for voice input, the pyttsx3 library to convert text to speech, 
the pywhatkit library to interact with YouTube, and the os and subprocess libraries to open and control various applications on the user's computer. 
It also uses the datetime library to get the current time, the wmi library for remote control feature. 
The script listens for commands, such as "play [song name]", "open Photoshop", "open VS Code", "open Brave browser", 
"remote control", "time" and "hibernate" and performs the corresponding actions. 
The script will run indefinitely in a loop and waiting for the user's voice commands.
